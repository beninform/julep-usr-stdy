              Did you work strictly down the list in order? Or did you skim the list looking for notable calls?
              Did you find the assist score helpful?
              How do you feel about your choices of which to view?
              Do you think that’s the same as when you’re working the ECCH desk?
              How do you think your choices about viewing match those of your colleagues?
